covfie: vector fields made easy
===============================

covfie (pronounced *coffee*) is a **co**-processor **v**\ ector **fie**\ ld
library. This header-only C++ library is designed to make the use of vector
fields as easy as possible, both on traditional CPUs as well as a variety of
co-processors. covfie is provided in the hope that it is useful for scientists
in the domain of high-energy physics, but also other fields where vector fields
are common, such as atmospheric sciences.
